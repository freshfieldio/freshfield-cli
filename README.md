## Installation

### Using npx (Recommended)

No installation needed, just run commands directly:

```bash
npx freshfield-cli init
npx freshfield-cli update
```

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g freshfield-cli
# or
pnpm add -g freshfield-cli

freshfield-cli update
```

**Alternative commands:** You can also use `freshfield` or `ff` instead of `freshfield-cli`.
